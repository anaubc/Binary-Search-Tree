# Binary-Search-Tree 
## Overview
This code is from an assignment from my *Data Structures and Algorithms* course from my program. 
It is a C++ implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST), which allows for efficient insertion, deletion and search operations.
We were tasked to implement some functions according to the constraints from the *binary-search-tree.h* file provided.
## Main Features
+ **Insertion**: Adds a new element to the BST while maintaining the binary search tree property.
+ **Deletion**: Removes an element from the BST and properly restructures the tree.
+ **Search**: Checks whether a given element exists in the tree.
+ **Height Calculation**: Computes the height (depth) of the tree.
+ **Traversal**: Prints the elements of the tree in level order (Breadth-First Traversal).
## Code Structure
+ **Node Structure**: Each tree node contains a value (val), a pointer to the left child, and a pointer to the right child.
+ **BinarySearchTree Class**: This class manages the BST and includes methods for insertion, deletion, searching, and other tree operations.
